# Getting Started with React17 Project Template

This is a template to have a quick start of a react project with React17 as there are lot of libraries that are not compatible with React18. This template is not meant to be used as a full-fledged project.

## Requirements

- Tested with nodejs v16.0.0

## Getting Started

React17 Project Template is a client side only project and is built by modifying the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) scripts.

### Installation and running

### Step 1. Install modules

From a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:

```
npm install
```

### Step 2. Running in development mode

In the project folder run:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the React app in development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Step 3. Build for testing and production use

A build of the app is necessary to deploy for testing purposes or for production use.
To build the project run:

```
npm run build
```
